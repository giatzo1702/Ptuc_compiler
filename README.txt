Description:
-------------

PTUC is a simplified version of pascal language. The current project contains
the lexical analyzer(flex) and the parser(byson) for this programming language. 
The project was implemented for educational purposes (for the course "Theory of
computation", School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University 
of Crete) and of course, for FUN :). Every addition or correction is more than 
desired!


Files of the project:
----------------------

mycompiler.l  :  the lexer
mycompiler.y  :  the parser
Makefile      :  the make file
