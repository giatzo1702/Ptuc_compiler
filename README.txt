Description:
-------------

PTUC is a simplified version of pascal language. The current project contains
the lexical analyzer(created using flex) and the parser(created using byson)
for this programming language. The whole project was done just for educational
purposes(for the course "Theory of computation", School of Electronic and
Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete) and of course, for FUN :).
Every addition or correction is acceptable!


Files of the project:
----------------------

mycompiler.l  :  the lexer
mycompiler.y  :  the parser
Makefile      :  the make file of the project
run.sh        :  the runner


How to run ptuc compiler:
--------------------------

1. Put your example .ptuc file in 'examples' folder.
2. Open a terminal in project's folder.
3. Run script 'run.sh': sh run.sh
4. Give the name of the example
5. See the results

Done!
